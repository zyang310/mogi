# CLAUDE.md — Mogi (AI mock interviewer)

Rules and a map of the codebase. Roadmap/status → [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Deep reference (data flow, full bindings, prompt spec, API contracts) → [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Purpose (why this exists)

**Mogi** (模擬, Japanese for "mock" — as in 模擬面接, *mock interview*) is a desktop app that runs a **live AI mock coding interview**. The user codes in their own IDE or a browser tab (VS Code, IntelliJ, terminal, LeetCode, NeetCode); the app screenshots their screen and an AI interviewer reads the problem *and* the code from the screenshot, then nudges Socratically — never handing over the answer.

**Screen-driven:** there is no problem bank and no written problem statement. The screenshot is the problem.

## Stack (what it's built with)

- **Wails v2** — Go backend + web frontend in one native binary, OS webview (no Chromium). Window runs **frameless + transparent** so the overlay can float over the user's IDE.
- **Go backend** — screen capture, all external API calls, SQLite, window/overlay control.
- **Frontend** — React + TypeScript + Vite. **Styling is plain CSS with Material Design 3 tokens (CSS variables) — no Tailwind.**
- **AI** — OpenRouter (vision models) via the Go backend.
- **Voice** — via the Go backend, **non-streaming** v1. Both STT and TTS resolve a provider behind the service layer's `service.TTS`/`service.STT` interfaces (`internal/service/providers.go`) — **Google** (default voice, low-cost) and **ElevenLabs** (Scribe STT + Flash TTS, premium). Each provider is self-sufficient (one key = full voice); the Settings toggle is **voice-only** (STT auto-prefers Scribe when its key is present, else Google), so with both keys the default is the optimal combo: Scribe STT + Google TTS. The mic records via `MediaRecorder` and is re-encoded to 16 kHz mono WAV client-side (`audioToWav`, since Google STT can't ingest WKWebView's AAC); all API calls happen in Go. Playback speed is applied client-side via `playbackRate`. The mic has two triggers: the click-to-toggle button, and **global push-to-talk** (below).
- **Voice hotkey** — a configurable global hotkey (default `Right ⌥ Option` — a bare modifier that avoids the macOS unhandled-key beep a combo would cause; Settings → Voice Hotkey). A backend OS-level keyboard hook (`internal/hotkey`, via `robotn/gohook`) fires a Wails `ptt:down` event per press; the frontend **toggles** recording on it — press to start, press again to stop & send — through the same recorder path as the mic button. Works while the IDE (not this window) is focused, cross-platform. The hook is **passive** (the key still reaches the IDE) and on **macOS requires Accessibility permission** — the OS dialog is summoned **at most once ever** (ask-once flag in the store); afterwards the Settings hint is the only reminder. Defaults to **enabled**.
- **Deps** — `kbinani/screenshot` + `golang.org/x/image` (capture), `mattn/go-sqlite3` (storage), `google/uuid`, `robotn/gohook` (global hotkey).

## Codebase map (where things live)

| Path | What / why |
|---|---|
| `main.go` | Entry point; Wails window options (frameless + transparent). |
| `app.go` | Wails binding facade: the single bound `App` struct, `NewApp` service wiring, and 1-line delegations into `internal/service`. Its exported signatures are the frozen TS surface. |
| `window.go` | The **only** file in `package main` that imports the Wails runtime: overlay enter/exit/resize, hide-window-for-snapshot, open-in-browser, window controls. |
| `window_zoom_darwin.go` | Darwin-only cgo/Cocoa path for the green-button zoom: animated `setFrame` to the true screen edges (under the Dock, below the menu bar) — the Wails runtime exposes neither animation nor Dock-inclusive positioning. `window_zoom_other.go` stubs it so `window.go` falls back to the instant runtime zoom elsewhere. The overlay is pinned with plain Wails always-on-top and deliberately does **not** try to cover another app's macOS full-screen Space (full-screen evicts all other windows by OS design); users are told to fill the window instead of full-screening it (ChatEmptyState). |
| `internal/service/` | **Business logic (the service layer)** — one file per concern: `interview.go` (active-session state + mutex, send loop, company starts, post-session meta extraction), `history.go` (transcripts, delete guard, debrief cache policy), `voice.go` (STT/TTS provider resolution + fallbacks), `settings.go` (keys + prefs, incl. propagation to capturer/hotkey), `account.go` (managed test accounts: activate/sign-out/launch-refresh + `applyKeyMode`, the single key-resolution rule), `providers.go` (RWMutex registry of live API clients + the `AI`/`TTS`/`STT`/`Speech`/`Screen`/store interfaces). Unit-tested against fakes (`fakes_test.go`) — no SQLite, no network, no OS hooks. |
| `internal/ai/` | OpenRouter client (`client.go`, incl. `ExtractSessionMeta` for history labels + final-code snapshot, `GenerateDebrief`) + prompts (`prompts.go`: shared base interviewer prompt, `BuildCompanySystemPrompt` + `companyProfiles` + templated openers, `SessionMetaPrompt`, `DebriefPrompt`). |
| `internal/problems/` | Company Practice question pools. `go:embed`-ed `data/problems.csv` (**algorithmic coding only** — filtered to LeetCode's `algorithms` category: no SQL/database, Pandas, Shell, Concurrency, JS — **factual metadata only**), parsed once into memory; `Companies`/`Problems`/`MockPair` (frequency-weighted two-problem draw); company display names come from the CSV's `name` column. `gen/` is a `go:generate` tool that rebuilds the CSV from [liquidslr/leetcode-company-wise-problems](https://github.com/liquidslr/leetcode-company-wise-problems), joining problem ids + acceptance from LeetCode's public `algorithms` API (which also acts as the category filter); run biweekly by `.github/workflows/refresh-problems.yml` (opens a data PR) or manually (network only when refreshing; the CSV is **committed**). |
| `internal/voice/` | ElevenLabs client (`client.go`): Scribe STT, Flash TTS, voice catalog. |
| `internal/googletts/` | Google Cloud client (`client.go`): TTS (synthesize + English voice catalog) **and** STT (`Transcribe`). Satisfies the same `Synthesize`/`ListVoices`/`Transcribe` shapes as `internal/voice`. |
| `internal/updater/` | GitHub-release update check (`updater.go`): compares the build's `main.version` against the latest release (semver, `golang.org/x/mod/semver`) so the UI can offer a download. External HTTP, mirroring `internal/ai`. Pure compare logic is unit-tested. |
| `internal/capture/` | Screen capture + region cropping. |
| `internal/hotkey/` | Global voice-hotkey keyboard hook (`listener.go`, via `robotn/gohook`) + hotkey spec↔keycode↔label mapping (`keymap.go`). Emits a Wails `ptt:down` event per press (frontend toggles recording on it); passive (doesn't swallow the key). |
| `internal/store/` | SQLite (`data.db`): sessions + messages (transcripts), preferences, API keys. Session-history reads/writes (`ListSessions`, `GetSessionTranscript`, `UpdateSessionMeta`, `DeleteSession`) live in `sessions.go`. `managed.go` adds the **managed key namespace** (`managed_*` rows) on the same pref primitives — no schema change, so BYOK and managed keys coexist untouched. |
| `internal/access/` | Client for the **access service** (`client.go`): `RequestCode`/`Verify`/`Keys` over the wire contract; `DefaultURL` points at the deployed Cloud Run service; 401/403 wrap the `ErrUnauthorized` sentinel that drives sign-out. External HTTP, mirroring `internal/ai`. |
| `access-service/` | **Separate Go module** (`module mogi-access`) — the deployed test-account service: invite + email OTP → developer-funded keys. `internal/server` (the 3 endpoints + rate limits), `internal/store` (Store interface; `memory.go` for dev, `firestore.go` for prod), `internal/mailer` (log \| Resend), `internal/openrouter` (mints a $3-capped key per tester). `ops/` holds the runbook scripts (kill switch, invites, revocation, provider verification). Deps never touch the root module. See its README. |
| `internal/models/` | Structs that cross the Wails boundary (Session, Message, Preferences, AuthStatus, Model, Voice, UpdateInfo, Problem, CompanyInfo, CompanySessionStart). |
| `frontend/src/App.tsx` | UI shell: floating pill nav → idle hub / company practice / active session / overlay. |
| `frontend/src/components/` | One component + its own CSS each, **grouped into a folder per feature (mostly a nav tab)**: `hub/` (HubReady), `company/` (CompanyPractice, CompanyBanner), `history/` (History — a timeline grouped by recency, each entry expanding inline to a Transcript/Debrief tab switch; SessionHistoryCard, TranscriptMessage, Debrief, RadarChart), `settings/` (Settings is a thin shell — sidebar nav + cross-cutting state (`prefs`/`savePrefs`, shared saving/error/success status, hotkey status) — rendering one `*Section` component per pane: General, Models, ApiKeys (+ ApiKeyCard, ManagedAccountCard), Voice, PushToTalk, Capture, Privacy, About; plus ModelPicker, VoicePicker), `session/` (Chat, ChatEmptyState, CapturePanel, Overlay, RegionSelector — the live interview), `setup/` (SetupPage — the two-door invite/BYOK fork; InviteActivation), `common/` (MessageBubble, WindowControls, UpdateBanner — shared UI + app shell). Cross-folder imports flow only **into** `common/`, never sideways. |
| `frontend/src/lib/` | `wailsBridge.ts` (single import point for bound Go methods + models + runtime `EventsOn`/`EventsOff`) + hooks (`useVoiceRecorder`, `useAudioPlayer`, `useUpdateCheck`, `useScrollFade`) + `hotkey.ts` (browser mirror of the Go keymap, for the Settings hotkey-capture UI) + `format.ts` (history date/duration/model formatting, recency grouping) + `verdict.ts` (hire-scale verdict → tone/color/score mapping, shared by History and Debrief). |
| `frontend/src/style.css` | MD3 design tokens (`:root` CSS variables) + global reset. |
| `frontend/wailsjs/` | Auto-generated bindings — **do not hand-edit**. |
| `docs/` | Roadmap, architecture reference, feature plans. |
| `site/` | The **trymogi.dev landing page** — plain static HTML/CSS, no build step, deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (which only runs on `site/**` changes; `build.yml` ignores them). Reuses the app's MD3 tokens so the two match. Commit site changes as `chore:`/`docs:` — `feat:` would make release-please cut an app release for a website edit. Deploy + custom-domain runbook: [site/README.md](site/README.md). |

## How to work on it

- **Toolchain is Go + npm** (not bun).
- **Run:** `wails dev` (hot reload) or `wails build` (binary). Frontend-only UI work: `cd frontend && npm run dev` — but Wails calls (`window.go.main.App.*`) no-op in a plain browser; stub them to preview.
- **Changed a bound Go method?** Run `wails generate module` (regenerates `frontend/wailsjs`), then export it from `lib/wailsBridge.ts`.
- **Verify changes:**
  - Go: `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `gofmt`.
  - Frontend types: `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit`.
  - UI behavior: browser preview with Wails calls stubbed. **Native window behavior** (overlay, always-on-top, transparency) can only be confirmed with `wails dev`.

## Rules

- **Comment for humans.** Every exported Go func and every React component/hook gets a short doc comment stating its purpose; comment the *why* for non-obvious logic. Match the existing density in `app.go` and `internal/ai/client.go`.
- **Modularize (3-layer backend).** Bound methods in `app.go` stay 1–3 line delegations — business logic goes in `internal/service` (one file per concern), data access stays in `internal/store`, and a new external integration is a new client package (e.g. `internal/voice`) wired into the `service.Providers` registry. Wails-runtime calls live only in `window.go`. Keep bound method **signatures** stable — they are the generated TS contract. Frontend: one component per file + its own CSS; all Go calls go only through `lib/wailsBridge.ts`.
- **Reusable UI.** Build small, single-responsibility components and compose them. Before adding markup, look for an existing component or class to reuse. Extract repeated UI into shared components/classes instead of re-implementing per screen — buttons (use the shared `.btn*` classes in `App.css`, not per-screen button styles), chips/badges, the pulsing status dot, icon buttons, the modal shell, glass panels. Reuse the MD3 tokens rather than duplicating values; lift shared behavior into hooks.
- **Screen-driven invariant.** Never send a written problem statement — the screenshot carries it. The interviewer persona lives in `internal/ai/prompts.go`. (Company Practice assigns a problem **by reference only** — title + difficulty + LeetCode link — never its text; the AI still reads the real problem off the screenshot.)
- **Styling.** Plain CSS + MD3 CSS-variable tokens (`style.css :root`); no Tailwind. Mockups come from Google Stitch (Tailwind) — port them to the tokens. One CSS file per component.
- **Secrets.** API keys live only in the Go backend (SQLite). The frontend never sees them. The AI never speaks unless the user typed/spoke first — no unprompted interruptions.
- **AI calls.** Always set `max_tokens` (replies are short; an unset cap 402s on low OpenRouter balances). See `internal/ai/client.go`.
- **Go.** `gofmt`; return errors, don't panic; wrap with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`; `json:"..."` tags on boundary structs; `context.Context` for cancellable ops (API calls, capture loops).
- **React.** Functional components + hooks only; handle loading/error state for every async Go call.
- **Commits.** Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). No hardcoded keys, ever. **The prefix is load-bearing:** release-please derives the next version from it — `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` → major; `chore:`/`docs:`/`refactor:` ship nothing. Never label a user-facing bug fix `chore:`, or it won't be released.
